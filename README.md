# columns-game-recreation

This was a project which focused on utilizing Python and the third party library Pygame to recreate a simplified version of the game known as "Columns". 
The game is quite similar to Tetris, as sets of falling Jewels of varying colors need to be rearranged to create matches of 
three or more same-colored Jewels and keep the game board as empty as possible. Once the board becomes overfilled, the game 
ends.

The full project was split into two assignments from a course at the University of California, Irvine called ICS32A or Python Programming with Libraries. These two assignments received full scores of 30/30, and the full project specifications can be found at the following two links:
